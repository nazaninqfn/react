If a function is called as part of a method in an object

, this in that function would always return a reference with an object.

However if that function is called as a stand alone function,
without an object reference,
//obj.method();
//function();

this by default returns a reference to the window object,

but if the strict mode is enabled

this will return undefined.
And that's the reason in this event handler we don'thave access to this.

So what is the solution?
Again in the last section I talked about the bind method.
We use that method to solve this problem.
