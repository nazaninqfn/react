a React application is essentially
a tree of components, so we can compose components together
to build complex user interfaces.

Props includes
data that we give to a component, whereas state includes
data that is local or private to that component
So,other components cannot access that state. It's completely internal
to that component. In other words, if you go to the counters

props is read only.
